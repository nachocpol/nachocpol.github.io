				<h2> Nature Rendering </h2>
				<p> 
					Nature scenes is an important part for many videogames. They are huge and detailed scenaries that have the power to inmerse the player in the game. It also comes with other kind of problems like rendering large terrains, realistic skies, undergrow generation and placement. All of this should be done at interactive framerates. For this project, I want to put together diferent elements and optimization techniques using DX12.

				<h2> Serious Engine - The R Island </h2>
				<p> 
					During my three years at ESAT I worked in Serious Engine, a 3D rendering engine made using C++ and OpenGl. Using this engine, I developed a demo scene: "The R Island", on it, you can see water rendering using planar reflections and refractions, procedural mesh placing, instancing, screen space light scatering (god rays), procedural texturing etc.

					Warp Drive is a first person arcade shooter made in UE4 for the Oculus Rift. The player is a combat pilot that has to help his army defeating the enemies. This project was made by a team of 4 programmers and 5 artists. I worked optimizing the game and also on the AI.
