				<h2> Nature Rendering </h2>
				<p id = "pJustify"> 
					Nature scenes is an important part for many videogames. They are huge and detailed scenaries that have the power to inmerse the player in the game. It also comes with other kind of problems like rendering large terrains, realistic skies, undergrow generation and placement. All of this should be done at interactive framerates. For this project, I want to put together diferent elements and optimization techniques using Opengl (selfmade framework).

				<h2> Demo my Sponza </h2>
				<p id = "pJustify"> 
					For this project, I had to take a basic framework provided by the university (with window creation and inner loop managment) and render the sponza scene. 
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Physically based rendering:</b> Implemented using CookTorrance and a self made enviromental mapping.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Shadow mapping:</b> With smooth edges using multiple samples and poisson sampling.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Deferred:</b> a deferred rendering pipeline. As it was my first attemp at deferred, I made it with a full fat G-buffer.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Antialiasing:</b> using a deferred renderer is very powerful but aliasing is a problem. I implemented FXAA to solve this problem.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>SSAO:</b> developed using John Chapman's article.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h2> Serious Engine - The R Island </h2>
				<p id = "pJustify"> 
					During my three years at ESAT I worked in Serious Engine, a 3D rendering engine made using C++ and OpenGl. Using this engine, I developed a demo scene: "The R Island", on it, you can see water rendering using planar reflections and refractions, procedural mesh placing, instancing, screen space light scatering (god rays), procedural texturing etc.

				<h2> Warp Drive </h2>
				<p id = "pJustify"> 
					Warp Drive is a first person arcade shooter made in UE4 for the Oculus Rift. The player is a combat pilot that has to help his army defeating the enemies. This project was made by a team of 4 programmers and 5 artists. I worked optimizing the game and also made a AI system to simulate large scale battles.

				<h2> Neonity </h2>
				<p id = "pJustify"> 
					Neonity is a sidescroller action based game with a neon/futurish style. It was developed
					by 2 programmers, 5 artists and 2 designers during 3 months. I worked on: player input, player actions like shooting or melee, interfaces, menus, drone enemy, hazards, unity plugins to improve the workflow and also on optimizations.

					Scene made with ray marching. The water shape is made using two fbm noise fields, it has
					reflection, reflaction, fake fresnel and fake sss. The clouds in the scene are done by
					performing multiple samples through 3d noise.
